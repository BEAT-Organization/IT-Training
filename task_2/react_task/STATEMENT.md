# Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-design-light.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You have to use `REACT` in this challenge and you can use any tools or libraries you like with REACT to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list [You can use [react-sortable](https://github.com/SortableJS/react-sortablejs)]

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Submitting your solution

You should submit your code via pull request to this repo [BEAT_IT](https://github.com/Mohamed-Ibrahim-01/BEAT_IT)

Your Submission must be inside a folder named as following : `<TODO>_<YourName>` and this folder to be inside submission folder of Task2.
